# PopDotfiles

Dotfiles and configuration script for the post-install process of Pop OS.

It aims to provide basic packages and configurations to keep consistency among my personal desktop and work laptop.

I've chosen Pop OS as my new operating system (after 13 years using Arch Linux) due to the amazing job that System76 is doing to provide out of the box functionality and compatibility for laptops like mine ( Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme ).
